title: Metis Chicago - Week 1, getting my bearings, and Project Benson
---

print(Hello World!)

(Lol, get it?) I'm a data scientist now and that's what data scientists say -- or so I'm told.

To be honest, I've never written a blog before. I feel weird writing about my experiences for other people to read. Like, actually, in 5th grade we had to keep a journal for the year for our teacher to read and I straight didn't do it. I almost failed 5th grade because of that. But I'm older and wiser now and am, thus, excited to share my experiences over the next 12 weeks at Metis with you!

BUT ANYWAY - this was my first week as a student data scientist at Metis. And WHAT A WEEK IT WAS! For me, this week was mainly spent as mentally orienting myself to the format of the program and retraining my body not to take a nap in the middle of every day.

Ok, I know the point of this blog is not to just write a bunch of corny anecdotes. The actual intent of this blog is to give whomever chooses to read this a better sense of my experiences at Metis.

The majority of this week was spent working on our first project: Project Benson. Paul was my partner and he was fantastic. Go Paul! When I get better at vim I'm going to figure out how to tag Paul in this post.

For Project Benson we had our first real task as data scientists. A (possibly fictional) tech company in New York sent us an e-mail asking us to take a look at MTA data. They are holding a gala and are interested in finding out which subway stations they should focus on to canvas at to get people to attend their event.(That was a run-on sentence maybe). In the end, we ended up using our recently-obtained knowledge of python, pandas, numpy (which is apparently pronounced numPIE and not numPEE as I previously believed), to determine that stations near tech hubs may be most beneficial for the Women Tech Women Yes canvassers.

As part of this first week I learned a lot more than I was expecting to. Along the same line, I learned that this bootcamp is going to be a lot of work. But that's not a bad thing. I'm excited to learn and explore python and pandas and to become an even more experienced data scientist. Our instructor Seth says that now we know enough to be useful to companies so maybe I'll just take his job. Does he read this? Whoever reads this don't tell him I said that. I'm not smart enough to take his job yet. Get back to me on that in 11 more weeks.

KIDDING. Seth is great. Zach is also great. Zach the dog is too.

Well that's all for this blog post.

Oh I did it again I'm so clever.
